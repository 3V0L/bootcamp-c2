# Hellobooks 

Hellobooks is a small library management API. It allows users to borrow and return books with a limit of 5 books being avaiilable to them at a time. 

Administrators are the only ones who can add, delete and edit books. Admins are registered through the use of a yandex mail email available [here](https://mail.yandex.com). If a different type of email is required it can be changed within the users model of the api. 

There is a time limit imposed on the weeks a user can borrow a book for, the time is 2 months. 

Any suggestions for improvements are greatly appreciated. 

## Hosted
The documentation is hosted on [apiary](https://hellobooks8.docs.apiary.io/)
The API itself is available on [heroku](https://hellobooks-tapiwa.herokuapp.com/)

## How to navigate through the application endpoints
- The app makes use of JWT tokens for authentication and can take JSON requests at will.
- Postman is used to input data and get output data from the system
- PyTest is used to test the endpoints of the APIs
- First register a user with a name, email and password. After that login. Then it is possible to change password, and borrow a book under a normal user
- For the book functions you need to enter the book data in the following JSON format otherwise it will raise an error:
```
{
    "title": "War and Peace",
    "author": "Leo Tolstoy",
    "date_published": "02/12/2008",
    "genre": "fiction",
    "description": "This is a description about the book war and peace by leo tolstoy",
    "isbn": "1112223334445",
    "copies": "5"
}
```
- User data is entered in teh same format with name, password and email being used for registration
- Email and Password are used for logging
- User data is also entered in json format and should take the same format as below
```
{
    'name': 'Tapiwa',
    'email': 'john@mail.com',
    'password': 'John2018'
